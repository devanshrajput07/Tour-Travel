        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>
          Travel is the movement of people between distant geographical
          locations. Travel can be done by foot, bicycle, automobile, train,
          boat, bus, airplane, ship or other means, with or without luggage, and
          can be one way or round trip. Travel can also include relatively short
          stays between successive movements, as in the case of tourism. Tourism
            is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of
            touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining
            tourists, and the business of operating tours. Tourism may be
            international, or within the traveller's country. The World Tourism
            Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go
            "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday
            activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside
            their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for
            leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".
